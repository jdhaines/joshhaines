"[The Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624)" by Malcolm Gladwell is a book I'm currently reading. It discusses how there are three types of people that bring about change. Connectors, Mavens, and Salesman. Connectors connect people together, Mavens are information gatherers, and salesman sell the ideas. I'm a Maven. Here is how one [blog](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/know-your-strength-for-more-success-are-you-a-connector-a-maven-or-a-salesman.html) summarizes the Maven discussed in Malcolm's book. Talk about a perfect description.

## Mavens are Information Specialists

> They are the ones who tell Connectors about what's hot. They always have the newest inside scoops on gadgets and specials. The upside of Mavens is that they amass a vast store of knowledge and are eager to share it with others. The downside is that Mavens can sometimes be a bit geeky and awkward around people.
>
> Here are some questions that will help you decide whether you are a Maven:
>
> - Do you enjoy reading junkmail?
> - Do you seek out the specials in your local store?
> - Do you tend to watch trends and know what's 'in'?
> - Do you study the market before buying a new gadget?
> - Do you tell your friends about special deals?
>
> If you said 'yes' to four or five of these questions, you are a Maven.
>
> **Mavens want to educate, not to sell.**
>
> They take delight in finding out the special deals that will save them money. And they are interested in new technology. They are the ones on the Internet who are the first to investigate new software, or a new laptop or mobile phone. And they don't keep what they find to themselves. They publish articles about their findings or let their socia media friends know what they think.
