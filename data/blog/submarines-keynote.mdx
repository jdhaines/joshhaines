## Introduction

I was recently asked to give a keynote speech at the Rolls-Royce Submarines Developer Conference in February 2025 which took place in Derby, UK. The talk was titled: **Unlocking Innovation: Enterprise Software and Culture**. The post below contains some sanitized details of the talk for both attendees to reference and others to learn from.

The talk was broken down into five main sections outlined below. Each section had an image / icon associated with the topic and was displayed on the slides and which were handed out as stickers after the conference.

> I need to take a minute to thank [Justin Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-johnson-psm-84b908132/) from [DeveloperTown](https://developertown.com/) for his help with the slide deck and these images. He's an amazing designer and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) wizard and this talk wouldn't have turned out nearly as well without his help.

## 01 - Psychological Safety

Psychological Safety is the first topic because it's, in my mind, the single most important aspect of a high-performing team. Without it, you can't have trust, and without trust, you can't have a high-performing team. It's the foundation of everything else we'll talk about today. I discussed this topic by referencing three books as I often do. These books are:

1. [Culture Code](/blog/book-shelf/culture-code) by _Daniel Coyle_: This book really taught and convinced me of the importance of psychological safety and how it's the foundation of a high-performing team.
2. [The Fearless Organization](/blog/book-shelf/fearless-organization) by _Amy Edmondson_: This book is a deep dive into how to implement psychological safety in your team or organization. I've implemented many of the practices in this book and have seen great results.
3. [The Right Kind of Wrong](/blog/book-shelf/right-kind-of-wrong) by _Amy Edmondson_: This book is acts as a manual for teams and leaders to understand the key role of failure in an organization and how to do it in the right way to learn, grow, and deliver at pace.
