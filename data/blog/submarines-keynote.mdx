## Introduction

I was recently asked to give a keynote speech at the Rolls-Royce Submarines Developer Conference in February 2025 which took place in Derby, UK. The talk was titled: **Unlocking Innovation: Enterprise Software and Culture**. The post below contains some sanitized details of the talk for both attendees to reference and others to learn from.

The talk was broken down into five main sections outlined below. Each section had an image / icon associated with the topic and was displayed on the slides and which were handed out as stickers after the conference.

He's an amazing designer and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) wizard and this talk wouldn't have turned out nearly as well without his help.

## 01 - Psychological Safety

</div>

Psychological Safety was the first topic because it is, in my mind, the single most important aspect of a high-performing team. Without it, you can't have trust, and without trust, you can't have a high-performing team. It's the foundation of everything else we'll talk about today. I discussed this topic by referencing three books as I often do. These books are:

1. [Culture Code](/blog/book-shelf/culture-code) by _Daniel Coyle_: This book really taught and convinced me of the importance of psychological safety and how it's the foundation of a high-performing team.
2. [The Fearless Organization](/blog/book-shelf/fearless-organization) by _Amy Edmondson_: This book is a deep dive into how to implement psychological safety in your team or organization. I've implemented many of the practices in this book and have seen great results.
3. [The Right Kind of Wrong](/blog/book-shelf/right-kind-of-wrong) by _Amy Edmondson_: This book acts as a manual for teams and leaders to understand the key role of failure in an organization and how to do it in the right way to learn, grow, and deliver at pace.

## 02 - Bureaucracy

</div>

Bureaucracy was the second topic because it's the single biggest killer of innovation in an organization. It's the enemy of agility and speed. I discussed similar things here as I did in my [podcast](/blog/behind-the-product-podcast) and in my [Calvium interview](/blog/calvium-interview). I referenced the book [The Delicate Art of Bureaucracy](/blog/book-shelf/delicate-art-of-bureaucracy) by Mark Schwartz which is seminal on this topic. We talked about methods to work through the bureaucracy, why it exists, and some _outside-the-box_ ways to deal with it.

## 03 - Special Unicorn

The third topic was all about how it is common in a company to feel like our problems are special and unique. This leads to people trying to invent totally new ways to do things when there are already proven methods out there. I mentioned that we should be using technologies that are neither unique, nor cutting edge.

Projects and technologies which are well established within organizations like the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) and [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) are solid candidates. It would also be a good idea to pick topics that someone can learn by watching YouTube videos, attending bootcamps, or with health communities and documentation. If we are heading in a special _company specific_ direction, it's likely the wrong choice.

I referenced the book [The Phoenix Project](/blog/book-shelf/phoenix-project) and [The Unicorn Project](/blog/book-shelf/unicorn-project) by Gene Kim which are great books on this topic. I also referenced the book [Accelerate](/blog/book-shelf/accelerate) by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim which really set a strong direction on DevOps as a process for achieving higher software delivery performance.

## 04 - Sacred Cows

</div>

The fourth topic was a chance to take out a few sacred cows of the industry around the difference of both _Agile_ vs. _Waterfall_ and moreso _agile_ vs. _Agile_. I discussed this through three main points:

1. **agile should be an adjective, not a noun**: I discussed how _agile_ is an adjective about the way you work, not something to do. It shouldn't be the task, it should be a way to achieve your tasks. Formal _Agile_ methods like Scrum can be useful, but they contain very specific solutions to solve very specific (and difficult) problems. If you aren't in charge of keeping 8-10 highly paid engineers busy on an ongoing basis, you probably don't need Scrum.
2. **Let the Problem Drive the Solution**: I talked about how the problem you are trying to solve should drive the solution. There are plenty of problems around our business where a _waterfall_ process is completely appropriate. I would argue we have very few places where formal _Agile_ methods are appropriate. Our company just isn't organized that way. That said, there are plenty of places where we can take some of the good learning and ideas from _agile methods_ and apply them to our work.
3. **Use Your Brain**: This may sound obvious, but we have an enormous number of talented colleagues and friends in this company. If we take a little time to think about a solution without formal methodologies getting in the way, we'll often come up with something far more simple and elegant. Use _agile_ as a tool towards better, faster, and cheaper solutions. Don't get stuck trying to shoehorn a formal methodology into a problem that doesn't need it.

## 05 - Partnership

<div className="flex flex-row justify-center">
  <img src="/static/images/stamp5.png" className="w-1/4" alt="partnership stamp" />
</div>

This last topic was all about working with our external partners and vendors. Big companies like ours can rarely handle everything we need without outside help. In the Software Factory team we pioneered a newer approach to working with our partners. We don't purchase software or even deliverables in our contracts, we simply purchase _**time**_. During that time, the vendor employees assigned to this project will join our team and we'll work together side-by-side to deliver on our goals. This model has been incredibly successful for us and I would encourage you to consider it in your own teams.

This model requires a mutual trust and respect between the organizations that rarely exists in the older _contractor / control_ model.

- We must trust the vendor to deliver on their promises of focus, effort, and time. If something takes longer than they initially think, we have to trust that they were working hard to deliver and the delay is a normal delay that could happen to anyone.
- The partner must trust that we will be fair with our expectations, timelines, and work projects. We need to account for onboarding, ramp-up time, and the inevitable _learning curve_ that comes with any new project.

We call this our _Burst Model_ where we can quickly burst one or more people onto our team to help deliver something in as short as a week or two.

I wish I could say I learned this in a book, but I didn't. This was a model which seemed obvious to me and from the first time we brought someone in to help with a project we used this model. Eventually, it became a standard working practice and it was only later I realized how strange this was across the rest of our business and other industries.
