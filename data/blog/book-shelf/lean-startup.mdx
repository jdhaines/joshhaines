Like [many](/blog/book-shelf/thinking-fast-and-slow) [other](/blog/book-shelf/devops-handbook) books in the [list](/blog/book-shelf), this book is a powerhouse and likely doesn't need another review from me. It has become almost standard reading for anyone in tech, and for good reason. Our Software Factory team uses concepts from this book almost every day. We drive hard on experimentation, rapidly adjusting, holding the line on agility, and beating back huge documents full of requirements. Since Software Factory began and continues to run as a "_Startup in an Enterprise_", the lessons from this book are invaluable.
