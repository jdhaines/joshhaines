I didn't think this was necessarily a bad book, but it wasn't great either. The general idea revolves around people who are stuck in the _busyness trap_ where they are too busy to be good leaders, or even to get things done. She makes the case that people need start saying no more, clear their schedules some, and slow down so they can lead more effectively.

For this type of benefit, I'd much recommend the book [essentialism](/blog/book-shelf/essentialism) discussed further up.
