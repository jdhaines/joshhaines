This book is a great introduction to the field of _Decision Analysis_. I was unfamiliar with this field prior to reading the book. It also provides a solid framework for using decision quality to increase the quality of decisions across multiple domains. The book is a bit dry, and may work better as a reference. It was valuable if for no other reason than to introduce me to the field of Decision Analysis as a whole.
