I really enjoyed this book. As a strong believer in the power of psychological safety (aligned with books like "[The Culture Code](/blog/book-shelf/culture-code)"), I found Amy Edmondson's exploration of the concept and its link to high performance particularly insightful. She offers clear instructions on how to foster it within teams.

Later, she provides a valuable set of questions and discusses a well-known survey for measuring psychological safety. Our Software Factory team has adapted this survey for quantitative insights into our own team dynamics.

This is the best book I've found on the topic. Any leader committed to the principles of psychological safety would benefit greatly from reading it and applying its lessons. I often pair it with [The Culture Code](/blog/book-shelf/culture-code) by Daniel Coyle. Both books provide a solid foundation for understanding the importance of psychological safety in high-performing teams.
