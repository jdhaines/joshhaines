## Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The notes below were from a discussion and chat with [John Matlik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-matlik-b261601/) and represents thoughts from each of us.

- Key attribute in a Start-up that gets lost in larger successful organizations = Humility!
  - "Sears let arrogance blind it to basic changes taking place in the marketplace."
  - "Often decisions & "pride" in times of plenty become the Achilles heel that leads to future fall in times of
    austerity."
  - "Successful companies" often ignore emerging megatrends that become the new products & services that render
    current products & services irrelevant.
- Bottom line: the "Innovator's Dilemma" = "_It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that
  there are such strong first-move advantages_"
  - Innovation = Change in tech to procure, present, sell, deliver, beyond only Engineering, Management, Marketing,
    Investment, Managerial Processes …
  - "_Sound decisions by great managers can lead a firm to failure_"
  - "_The logical, competent decisions of management critical to the success of companies are also why they lose their leadership._"
- To resolve the dilemma, we need to acknowledge a dual reality of large successful businesses:
  1. Need near term survival & growth to sustain the health of large business, but also …
  2. Need long-term sustainment & the ability to address/pivot to disruptions that could cause businesses to fail or go
     bankrupt—particularly in an environment of increasing pace of tech emergence.
- Three key differences in the above two items:
  - Sustaining technologies (which improve established products & services) vs. disruptive technologies (which create
    different value props & new customer value)
  - The Pace of technology can outstrip what the market needs at that time (thus timing for investment is important &
    requires a focus on and ability to define 'value')
  - Customers & financial structures of "successful companies" put 'filters' on what is most valuable/attractive (driven heavily by corporate culture).
- Characteristics/attributes of 'disruptive products or services':
  - Simpler
  - Cheaper
  - Smaller
  - More convenient
