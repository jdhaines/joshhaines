This was a good book, although a bit longer than it needed to be. Adam Grant (the author) has a huge amount of experience on changing people's minds as an organizational psychologist. He slowly weaves together a rich view of why the ability to re-think past positions and decisions is critical to being successful in this day and age. People have a tendency to make a decision about a belief or value and then let them become entrenched over time. Those people who are able to re-think their positions will have an enormous advantage over others whose views become stagnant.

At its core, this book is an exposition on an aspect of the Dunning-Kruger effect that we all know and love. The concept is valuable, and we all can benefit from considering whether we should re-think our decisions and values more frequently.

This book kept making me think of [Thinking Fast and Slow](/blog/book-shelf/thinking-fast-and-slow) by Daniel Kahneman. The two books are very different, but they both have a lot to say about how we think and make decisions. They also both make you think about how fast off-the-cuff decisions relate to slow deliberate decisions. I would recommend both books to anyone who is interested in decision-making and thought leadership.
