This is a wonderful book that is hard to describe.
Essentially, the book is laid out from early career to late career.
Tony goes through each stage of someone's career and describes two things:

1. What was happening to him and his career at the time. In this way, the book is semi-autobiographical.
2. The advice he would give someone in that part of their career. This makes the book sort of "_mentor in a box_" with one of the best in the business.

Tony Fadell has a long and storied resume, but his biggest claim to fame is being the leader of the team who created the iPod. This book is chock-full of great pieces of advice on how to build great products and teams and be your best throughout your career.

It's a fantastic book, I highly recommend it.
