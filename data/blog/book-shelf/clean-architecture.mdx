Similar to [Clean Code](/blog/book-shelf/clean-code),
this is another solid book about how to plan out and design software so it is more maintainable and robust.
Robert's writing style is very clear and concise with enough anecdotes from a long career to be useful.
I would recommend this whole series to anyone starting into programming
or who is looking for programming-related books/audiobooks.
