Like [_The Phoenix Project_](/blog/book-shelf/phoenix-project), this book follows a fictional company undergoing a digital transformation. The authors draw on their extensive experience with DevOps and DevSecOps transformations to paint a realistic picture of common challenges. These books are truly excellent!

This installment focuses specifically on a developer who needs to revolutionize the way the business creates software. "The Phoenix Project" delves more into high-level management and leadership within IT Operations and Development.

What's especially cool is that it's a modern book touching on real-world technologies like Docker, Vagrant, Terraform, and Clouds. It's timely and feels tailor-made for our Rolls-Royce... even addressing the lengthy technology approval process managed by people who might be less familiar with modern tech (ahem...).

Seriously, stop what you're reading and pick up "The Unicorn Project"!
