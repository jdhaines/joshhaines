This is a book which largely doesn't need an introduction or summary from me. It is well known, well respected, and well worth the read. Daniel Kahneman is a Nobel laureate and a psychologist who has spent his life studying how we think and make decisions. This book is a almost a culmination of his life's work and is a must-read for anyone who is interested in decision-making and thought leadership.

For those four people who haven't read it yet, the book discusses two decision making systems within our minds.

- System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It is the system that makes snap decisions and is often wrong.
- System 2 is slow, deliberate, and logical. It is the system that makes well-thought-out decisions and is often right.

The book discusses these systems in detail and explains how they interact with each other. It also explains how we can use this knowledge to make better decisions in our lives. Many other books which have come out reference this book and its concepts. Examples from my own [book shelf](/blog/book-shelf) include [Think Again](/blog/book-shelf/think-again), [Made to Stick](/blog/book-shelf/made-to-stick), and [Indistractable](/blog/book-shelf/indistractable).

Do yourself a favor and go grab this book if you haven't read it yet.
