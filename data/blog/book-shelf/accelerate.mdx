## Notes

> [!NOTE]
> This was the first book I ever added to my book shelf. I was expecting to write a table for each book detailing important points and actions I'd take for our internal [Software Factory](/blog/sf-history-1) team. I've removed a bit of that, but decided to leave this formatting as-is to remind myself of the initial plans and how much they have changed.

| #   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                             |     |

| 1   | Developers need to be able to run tests and run apps on their workstations                                                                                                        |
| 2   | Successful teams had adequate test data to run their tests. Consider making test data as proxy for all real data.                                                                 |
| 3   | Maturity models don't make sense, need capability models for evaluating                                                                                                           |
| 4   | Teams should be able to choose their own tools based on users of the tools                                                                                                        |
| 5   | Keeping system config and app config in version control is more important than application code                                                                                   |
| 6   | Devs need to create their own tests, not made by another team. Also if tests pass then code should be releasable                                                                  |
| 7   | If devs are full time, trunk based is best with daily merges back to master and short lived branches. Open source or part time projects can have longer branches a la github flow |
| 8   | Consider team apis and bounded context as a way to more loosely couple teams. High performance happens when a team can change the way it works without permission of other teams. |
| 9   | Letting people use their own tools contributes to software and organization                                                                                                       |
| 10  | IA and IT Security should provide libraries and tools to devs and engineers and make their use optional but encouraged.                                                           |
| 11  | Architects should focus on engineers and outcomes, not tools or technologies. Doesn't matter if developers hate using them, focus on people and what they want.                   |
| 12  | Infosec and IA need stop be involved throughout, can't be a bottleneck at end as changes are hard and expensive. Plus it slows down our goal of fast deployments                  |
| 13  | Rugged Manifesto is alternative to DevSecOps                                                                                                                                      |
| 14  | Having a manager or change board review deployments doesn't work, doesn't lead to better performance.                                                                             |
| 15  | Traditional IT Approval processes are **risk management theater**                                                                                                                 |
| 16  | Consider formalizing 20% time, Friday afternoons, or time to work on any other project for the company.                                                                           |
| 17  | Yak days (for technical debt) and half days (for other ).                                                                                                                         |
| 18  | Allocate training budget and let employees use it how they find .                                                                                                                 |
