## Overview

As an overall, I'd rate this book as a _Skip_. I saw the author and the tagline and grabbed it. It's a short book that essentially feels like Peter just rambling through some thoughts on random topics for a few hours.

In general, Peter Thiel is a pretty amazing person to hear ramble for a couple hours. But I didn't find most of it super useful. The pitch for the book is essentially _ramblings on startups_ which I guess fits to the book.

I feel like if you want to read through a book of a super successful person waxing philosophical on useful topics, I'd recommend [Build](/blog/book-shelf/build) by Tony Fadell. That one was amazing and was structured in a way of him talking to people at his level as he progressed through his career.

## 7 Questions

- The Engineering Question
- The Timing Question
- The Monopoly Question
- The People Question
- The Distribution Question
- The Durability Question
- The Secret Question

One thing I found useful in this book was a discussion about the "**7 Questions**" that all new start-ups (especially tech startups) need to consider.

There are details in the book about what each of these questions are and why we might need to answer them. I like it as a framework for considering a new idea for a business. As with other
books on the [list](/blog/book-shelf), I wonder if this was a core idea and they decided to scale up a book around it. I've found a number of books that feel like a solid long blog post
which have been built up into a book somewhat unnecessarily.  His concept of "_Building the Future_" feels a bit overblown for the content of the book.

## Wrap-Up

I wouldn’t call this a bad book, but it’s not one I’m likely to recommend or rate highly on my [book shelf](blog/book-shelf).
