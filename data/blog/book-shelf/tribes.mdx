I enjoyed this book. It is highly recommended across many different communities on the internet, and I can see why. In the book, Seth lays out a case for why we need more leaders in the world. He discusses how people growing communities are leaders whether they believe it or not. He also discusses how to lead and how to grow a tribe. He contrasts these leaders with what he calls "Sheepwalkers" who are people who are just following the status quo and not leading. This book really made me think of the powerful phenomenon _Learned Helplessness_. You can read more about learned helplessness [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness).
