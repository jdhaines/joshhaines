This was a good overview type book for people not as technical or close to this _modern software_ space. It has great high-level concepts and information about the modern IT enterprise. If you read his other book near the top of our list ([A Seat at the Table](/blog/book-shelf/seat-at-the-table)), you'll have gained most of the value from this book.

If, like me, you just like Mark Schwartz and his writing, then feel free to go through this one as well.
