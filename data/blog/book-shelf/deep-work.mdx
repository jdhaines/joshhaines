This book provided valuable insights into the benefits of deep work and sustained engagement. It effectively explains why focused, uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to enhance their work output. Inspired by this book, I've begun blocking off two afternoons a week as "out of office" for concentrated, in-depth problem-solving.
