I found this book extremely powerful. It presents research on how some leaders multiply their teams' intelligence and performance, while others diminish it. The author provides compelling examples of both leadership styles, along with telltale signs to recognize them.

One powerful concept is the _accidental diminisher_ - a well-meaning manager who unintentionally undermines their team's ability to excel.

Surprisingly, the characteristics of a "Multiplier" aren't always intuitive. They can be demanding and even "tiring" to work for. However, their team members feel pushed to give their absolute best and take pride in their work and rapid growth.

I really enjoyed this book and plan to revisit its lessons. I'll aim to incorporate Multiplier principles into my leadership style while actively avoiding Diminisher tendencies.
