Radical Candor was one of the first books I read when I first started leading a team. It was my first time and I wasn't sure where to start. I had never considered myself a leader or a manager and really just focused on the technical delivery of work. Similar to the open teaser to [my podcast](/blog/behind-the-product-podcast), I tried to let technical ability win the day. This book helped give me some initial insights and led to the type of culture I wanted to have within my team. In some ways this really opened the door to later reading and efforts around psychological safety, ultra transparency, the concept of _bring your whole self to work_, and other things that make my team what it is. I feel like our [culture](/blog/book-shelf/culture-code) has set us apart within the larger enterprise and has helped us to deliver at a speed and volume that is unmatched.
