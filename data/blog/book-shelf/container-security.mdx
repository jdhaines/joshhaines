This book is pretty dry to actually read through, but delivers on the promise from the title. I needed to shore up my understanding of how containers are secured, what exactly they are from a process and computer hardware standpoint, and how to ensure we're getting the benefits without opening ourselves up to any extra risks. I needed to be able to talk intelligently about how using containers was the right path and aligned to industry, and this book helped me get to that point.
