## Introduction

This is the [second](./deep-work) book by Cal Newport that I've read. The advertisements and cover of this book had tempted me for awhile, and I grabbed it on an impulse one day.

> [!NOTE]
> I typically spend about 2.5-3 hours on the lawn mower each week through the summer. During those times I make a lot of audiobook progress, and sometimes I finish a book in the middle of a
mowing session.
>
> It's those times when I'm most susceptible to just grabbing the next interesting looking book in the line-up rather than picking from my carefully curated wish-list / to-read list.

The core of this book is about a relatively simple concept: **the conventional wisdom that you should follow your passion is incorrect. You should work hard to get good at something and it
will turn into your passion**.

I like this concept and feel it's something I had always felt, but never realized how to put it so clearly.

## Hobby vs. Career

I graduated college with a degree in Materials Engineering, and started working in that field as a start to my career. Soon after, I got a Masters in Engineering in nearly the same field, although my masters was slightly more generalized around aerospace engineering. I had planned to keep my career headed in this direction, although I never felt passionate about it. I was excited to be done each day and focus on my hobby which was software, websites, working on computers, etc.

I ended up starting a side business building websites and working on computers. I made a little money at it, but never much more than enough to keep my computer upgraded with the newest parts. My career and my hobby were always separate in my mind.

## Hobby as a Career

The whole time during my first job (Honeywell Aerospace) I was doing my work as well as fiddling around with various digital projects ranging from fancy excel files, internal websites, and the like. At my second main job (Johns Manville) I worked as a Materials Engineer and Chief Reliability Engineer for most of my time while also building internal websites, and even a big machine learning classification system that would help operate and predict quality on a huge production line.

Finally, at Rolls-Royce I started as a materials engineer and eventually switched full time to start the Software Factory (a story I've [told before]()). It wasn't until roughly 5 years after that point that the concept in this book became clear.

## Wrap-Up

I was improving and getting better at the software side of things over the years. I didn't have a passion for it initially, I stuck with it because I enjoyed that the field moved quickly and I always had more to learn.

It's only now, looking backward, that I love it and am passionate about it because I've become good at it. I think the _Chicken or the Egg_ question still remains, but I think there is merit to what the author is saying and I'm in general agreement.
