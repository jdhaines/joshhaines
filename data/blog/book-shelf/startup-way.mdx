This book is essentially a follow-on to [The Lean Startup](/blog/book-shelf/lean-startup) by the same author. It's a great read and provides a lot of insight into how to apply the principles of Lean Startup to larger organizations. It's been reviewed a number of other places and I don't have a lot more to add. I will say that I found it a little repetitive, and felt like on-balance you would be better off reading [XLR8](/blog/book-shelf/xlr8) by John Kotter instead. For me, the most valuable part was talking about how you can use the benefits and principles of a startup while inside a large organization and the Kotter book explains this better.
