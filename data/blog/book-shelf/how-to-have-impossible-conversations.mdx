I grabbed this book based on a passing ad and brought my own thoughts as to what I hoped to learn from this book. Unfortunately, the ad didn't accurately reflect what the book contained.

In general, this book sets up a series of skills ranging from beginner to master that will help someone to have productive conversations with people who are more and more entrenched, immovable, and reluctant to see reason. Essentially, this book helps you argue with trolls and entrenched zealots on social media.

I would love to say that the book had other uses... and maybe it does for some people, but they continuously returned to the same examples of zealots on social media arguments. Overall, I felt like the book missed a great opportunity to expand the reader base who could benefit from these skills. Not a bad book, but not immensely useful.
