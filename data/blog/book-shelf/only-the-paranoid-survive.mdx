> I heard about this book from [John Matlik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-matlik-b261601/) who said [Candice Bineyard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candicebineyard/) was discussing one of it's key points in a leadership meeting. I grabbed it and read through it quickly. H/T to them for the recommendation!

This was a short book with one powerful message:

> _**Strategic Inflection Points** represent danger and opportunities for businesses._

According to the author, strategic inflection points are periods when "_massive change occurs and a company must, virtually overnight, adapt or fall by the wayside--in a new way._"

This is a simple idea that can have big consequences to businesses of all kinds. These moments are always very clear in hindsight or during a review of the history of an industry. The hard part is to both:

1. Recognize an inflection point is occuring and
2. Have the organizational maturity, flexibility, and courage to react in a way that takes advantage of it

Overall, I liked the book. It is certainly dated, and the sections that were questioning the future of the internet were a little silly. It is worth quickly reading through or at least finding some nice cliff notes.
