I enjoyed this book for its strong foundation in solid programming principles. It's no surprise the tech
industry widely references and recommends it - Robert Martin ("Uncle Bob") is a legend, and this book,
along with [Clean Architecture](/blog/book-shelf/clean-architecture) and [Clean Coder](/blog/book-shelf/clean-coder), exemplifies his expertise.

Martin first expertly explains core concepts and principles for writing maintainable, robust code. He then applies these concepts through insightful case studies, demonstrating how to improve and refactor legacy code. Finally, he provides a helpful list of "code smells" to watch for in older projects.
