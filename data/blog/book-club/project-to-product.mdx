Overall, this was a powerful book which teaches a new way to think about how work gets done in organizations.
Mik often references a career-altering trip to the BMW factory in Germany.
He talks
about how they've made huge leaps in improvements in their digital and software thinking by learning and adapting manufacturing methods.

You can find many examples of top tier manufacturing.
In many ways, this is a solved problem.
Lean, Toyota Systems, Kanban,
and other powerful systems have been implemented to nearly perfect levels with so many books and examples available.
It seems, however,
that we're only just now starting to see how all that can apply to creating digital products and software.

## Flow Framework

In this book, he explains a framework to think through this process.
In the process, you come to realize he isn't explaining anything new, just through a new lens.
He calls this system the _Flow Framework_.

> [!CAUTION]
> He owns a company which sells consulting services in this direction as well as a software tool which makes implementing this framework easier... there is a bit of a sales pitch, but I also saw the value in the vision.

In this process, you do a fairly traditional value stream map of your part of the business.
You come up with what your _widget_ is.
You determine the single unit of work your team or teams work through.
In a factory it might be a single car.
In a software development team, it might be a user story.
In an engineering team, it might be one vibration analysis.
You then start to track each unit as it moves through the value stream.
He has four metrics called the _Flow Metrics_ that are measured and reported on.
These metrics help you get a powerful view of bottlenecks in the flow just like they have in factories.

## Work Labels

Another hugely useful concept we implemented immediately is his labeling system. He uses a system of 4 labels which are MECE (Mutually Exclusive & Comprehensively Exhaustive). In simple terms, each piece of work gets one and only one of these labels.

- Risk (Work on something that will prevent the future delivery of value)
- Debt (Work which will allow better delivery of value in the future)
- Feature (New Value added)
- Fix (Correcting mistakes or issues with previously delivered value)

We've found that these four labels are extremely powerful and useful.
Following his guidelines,
you can plot how much of each type of work is happening and understand the state of your value stream.

E.g., If you're spending all your time on features, you'll eventually slow down and be overloaded with technical debt. If you're fixing too many things, then your processes are poorly performing, and you should slow down and burn down some debt to improve your processes.

> [!TIP]
> The concept of MECE is a powerful one. We've found ourselves using this idea in other areas of our business. There are more places than you might think where the concept of _Mutually Exclusive & Comprehensively Exhaustive_ is useful.

This framework has been immensely useful to us, and I can't recommend this book enough.
