I had been wanting to read this book for some time. As with many other people in this industry, I'm a big fan of Gene Kim and his other books including [Accelerate](#), [The Phoenix Project](/blog/book-club/phoenix-project), [The Unicorn Project](/blog/book-club/unicorn-project) and [The DevOps Handbook](#). In this new book Gene and Steven Spear discuss an novel concept around thinking and acting to create a winning organization.

{/* #TODO fix links to other books */}

The book primarily revolves around three areas: Slowification, Simplification, and Amplification. Briefly:

- **Slowification**: A method in which you modify the environment in which a problem is solved to _make problem-solving easier._
- **Simplification**: A method in which you make the problems themselves _easier to solve_ through:
  - **Modularization**
  - **Incrementalization**
  - **Linearization**
- **Amplification**: A method where you make it more obvious that _problems are occurring_ so they can be seen and solved.

These concepts aren't exactly new, but it does feel like a very new way of thinking about them and organizing them. This book feels very well thought-out and is full of well-reasoned and approachable examples of how to apply these principles. The information in this book felt novel and fresh and I found myself thinking about how to apply these principles to my own work. Unlike so many books today, the authors didn't just pad a great blog post into a book. I really appreciated this book and it will be [ranked](/blog/book-club) highly in my list of books.
