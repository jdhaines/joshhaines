    description: `I ran a small web design company for more than a decade.  I never really made much money at it, but it was a great hobby and a great way to learn more about tech.  I've since switched my career to development based on what I learned during this time.  The styling is dated, but the color scheme influenced this new personal site because I still like the way the colors work together.`,
