      "Custom website built almost completely by my awesome 9 year old daughter, Jenny.  She even has the code in GitHub.  I set up a pipeline to deploy it using AWS's Amplify service which works great for small websites like this one.",

    description: `I ran a small web design company for more than a decade.  I never really made much money at it, but it was a great hobby and a great way to learn more about tech.  I've since switched my career to development based on what I learned during this time.  The styling is dated, but the color scheme influenced this new personal site because I still like the way the colors work together.`,

    description: `I've rebuilt my own website a number of times.  Most recently I used a Next.js template and then customized it to my liking.  I had a design company on Fivrr design the logo after I provided the colors.  I stole the idea from my previous JoshPro website as I thought the Orange and Blue looked great.  I wanted the logo to have something to do with aerospace as I've always worked in that industry and I think they did a great job.`,
